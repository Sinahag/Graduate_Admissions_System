# Graduate_Admissions_System
This project was a group development of a system which could read and write graduate applicants into a system. Using linked lists to store students, the system was able to perform sorting in respect to different categories (CGPA, Research Score, First/Last Name, TOEFL Score etc.), add/delete, searching and merging of students. Ultimately, the program can set a threshold as to what grades a student needs to pass the threshold and get into SFU's graduate school and perform the query functions aside it.
